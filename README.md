# 11_Homework_Express_Js_Note_Taker

## Description

The motivation was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

I learnt about using node js, Express Js, and much more.
